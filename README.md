# touch-voltage

Statistical treatment of the grounding grid touch voltage. 

The risk of exceeding a tolerable touch voltage of the grounding system under short-circuit events. It features a probability density function of applied touch voltage, which is derived from statistical short-circuit calculations combined with numerical simulations of grounding grid surface potential distributions. A tolerable touch voltage is, at the same time, depicted with a cumulative distribution function, which takes into account the resistance of the human body and its footing, along with the short-circuit duration and its onset probability. Risk is obtained by numerically integrating over the product of these two probability distribution functions. 

A further probability of a person's exposure to the dangerous voltage is introduced, which accounts for the short-circuit duration, exposure duration in the vicinity of the grounding system and average number of incidents per year. This probability can be combined with the risk of exceeding a tolerable touch voltage of the grounding system under a short-circuit event to obtain a total risk of danger to human life from the touch voltage.
